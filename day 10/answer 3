grid-auto-rows and grid-auto-columns are properties in CSS Grid that allow you to specify the size of implicitly created rows and columns in the grid. These properties come into play when you have more items in your grid than the explicitly defined rows and columns can accommodate.
grid-auto-rows: This property is used to set the size of implicitly created rows in the grid. When you have more grid items than the specified number of rows in your grid, additional rows are automatically created to accommodate the extra items. The size of these automatically generated rows is determined by the value of grid-auto-rows.
