JavaScript is a programming language used in web development to add interactivity and dynamic functionality to websites. Its key roles include:

Client-Side Scripting: Runs in the user's browser to create dynamic web pages without constant server communication.
Enhancing User Experience: Enables interactive elements like sliders and pop-ups for better user engagement.
Form Validation: Validates user input in web forms for data integrity and instant feedback.
Event Handling: Responds to user actions like clicks and scrolls for interactive features.
DOM Manipulation: Updates HTML content and styles dynamically without page reloads.
Asynchronous Programming: Executes tasks without blocking the main thread for smoother performance.
Building Web Applications: Powers modern frameworks like React and Angular for scalable and feature-rich web applications.
