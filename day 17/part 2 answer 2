Here are the key differences between JavaScript and HTML, along with examples of situations where you would use each:

JavaScript:
Purpose: JavaScript is a programming language used for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.
Execution: It is executed on the client-side (in the user's browser).
Examples of Use:
Form validation: Checking if user inputs are valid before submitting a form.
Creating interactive elements: Implementing features like sliders, dropdown menus, and pop-up dialogs.
Handling events: Responding to user actions such as clicks, mouse movements, and keypresses.
Making AJAX requests: Fetching data from a server and updating the page content without reloading the entire page.
Implementing animations: Creating animated effects like transitions, fades, and scrolling effects.
HTML:
Purpose: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the web.
Static: HTML provides the structure and content of a web page, but it does not provide interactivity or dynamic behavior.
Examples of Use:
Creating the structure of a web page: Defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and tables to organize content.
Adding media: Embedding images, videos, and audio files into web pages.
Defining forms: Creating input fields, buttons, and other form elements for user input.
Linking pages: Using anchor tags (<a>) to link to other web pages or resources.
Semantic markup: Applying semantic tags like <header>, <footer>, <nav>, and <article> to define the structure of a document and its sections.
Example Situations:
Use JavaScript when: You need to add interactivity, validate form inputs, handle user events, fetch data from a server dynamically, or create animations.
Use HTML when: You want to define the structure and content of a web page, embed media, create forms, define links, or apply semantic markup to improve accessibility and SEO.
