Choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript is important because it:

Enhances code readability and understanding.
Facilitates code maintenance and updates.
Reduces cognitive load by eliminating ambiguity.
Fosters effective collaboration among team members.
Example: 

// Unclear variable names
let x = 10;
let y = 5;
let z = x + y;

// Clear variable names
let width = 10;
let height = 5;
let area = width * height;
