Conditional statements in JavaScript are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. These statements allow your code to make decisions and execute different code blocks based on whether a condition (or set of conditions) is true or false. The primary conditional statements in JavaScript are if, else if, else, and switch.
The if Statement
The if statement is used to execute a block of code only if a specified condition is true.
Syntax:
if (condition) {
  // code to be executed if condition is true
}
Example : 
let age = 18;
if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You can vote.");
}




The else Statement
The else statement is used to execute a block of code if the same condition is false.
Syntax:
if (condition) {
  // code to be executed if condition is true
} else {
  // code to be executed if condition is false
}


let age = 16;
if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You can vote.");
} else {
  console.log("You cannot vote.");
}

The else if Statement
The else if statement is used to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.
Syntax:
if (condition1) {
  // code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // code to be executed if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
  // code to be executed if condition1 and condition2 are false
}


let score = 75;
if (score > 80) {
  console.log("Excellent");
} else if (score > 60) {
  console.log("Good");
} else {
  console.log("Needs Improvement");
}


The switch Statement
The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions. It is often used as an alternative to multiple if statements.
Syntax:
switch(expression) {
  case x:
    // code block
    break;
  case y:
    // code block
    break;
  default:
    // code block
}
let day = 2;
switch (day) {
  case 1:
    console.log("Monday");
    break;
  case 2:
    console.log("Tuesday");
    break;
  case 3:
    console.log("Wednesday");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Another day");
}
