<h1>The z-index Property</h1>

<img src="../images/answer-3.jpg">

<p>The z-index is used to positioned elements on the z-axis, it determines which elements appear in front of or behind other elements.

Higher z-index: Elements with a higher z-index value will appear in front of elements with lower z-index values. Think of it like layers in a stack of cards.

Default z-index: auto
Negative z-index: Elements with a negative z-index value are placed behind elements with default or positive z-index values.</p>
